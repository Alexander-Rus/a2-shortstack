For this assignment I decided to make a music saving web application. If you want to keep track of your favorite
songs, all you have to do is add the name of the song, the artist, the length of the song(in minutes), a url
to a picture of the artist(s) and a url to a music video of the song. With each new addition to the list, you 
are given a running count that keep track of how long the playlist is going to be. 

If I had more time I would have really liked to have added the feature that actually lets you add pictures of the band directly into the table. I also would have liked to make a playlist section where the user could put different songs for different occassions

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I fufilled all the base requirments of the assignment. I made sure to have a server that serves files, a resuts functionality, a form/entry functionality, a way to store the inputted data, and a derived 
field(the total time of the songs). 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I added multiple fields that allow the user to keep track of as many songs as they want. I used a json format to store the data within the server logic. 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I added an option to delete rows so when you don't want a song to be on the list anymore, you can delete it. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I also had to add additional cased to the server.improved.js to make sure that all of my commands worked correctly

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: In the style.css file, I made a lot of improvements. I fufilled the base requirments 
of having element selectors, id selectors, and class selectors. I also had elements centered horizontally, and two elements centered together next to eachother. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: For almost all elements I added different margins and paddings to compliment colors or both the background and the buttons and fields. 
- **I ate some pizza**: I used the @media tag to try and distinguish when the size of the window changes, that way 
my web app should work on multiple different screen sizes.
